# Codelyst

This app is meant to let users 
- create lists: a list is a recipe for doing something in code (set up authentication in rails, make a nested form...)
- each list is initiated with a first original version from the user who create the list
- other users can also contribute to the list by submitting another version: it is another way to make the recipe
